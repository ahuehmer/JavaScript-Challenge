# **JavaScript-Challenge**

The JavaScript challenge consisted of building an interactive dashboard that lets a user explore a dataset on microbes that colonize human bellybuttons. The user can input a certain test subject's ID. The dashboard will then update to display the demographic info for this test subject, a bar chart showing the top ten microbial species found in that person's bellybutton, as well as a bubble chart that displays all found bacteria. 

The dashboard can be accessed with the following link: https://ahuehmer.github.io/JavaScript-Challenge/
